# U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Child Detentions 

### Topic 

This project aims to identify which factor(s), if any, influence the amount of time minors are detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in order to build a model that can predict how much time one is likely to spend in CBP custody.  

### Reason for Selecting Topic 

Considering the detention of minors by CBP has been a major topic in public discourse -- particularly over the past three or four years, pulling insights from the data could allow us to identify trends and address potential detrimental impacts of the detentions.  

### About the Data Source

This project uses [data] (https://github.com/themarshallproject/cbp-migrantchildren-detention-data) collected by The Marshall Project from CBP via a Freedom of Information Act request. The CSV contains more than 580,000 rows of data covering each time the agency detained migrant children since January 20, 2017.  

### Questions the Data Can Answer

Possible questions we could answer from this data include: 
- How much time is one likely to spend in CBP custody once we know their age, country of origin, and/or gender. 
- Are certain age groups more likely to be detained? Or are certain age groups detained for a longer time than others? 
- Does country of origin play a role in likelihood of detention or time spent detained?
